# Business Impact Analysis ‚Äì Mock Assignment

This document is a mock Business Impact Analysis (BIA) I completed as part of a graduate-level cybersecurity risk management course. It evaluates key business functions, operational impacts, and risk areas for a fictional cloud services company, and outlines recommendations to support a future business continuity plan.

## üß† What I Learned

Working on this BIA assignment helped me develop a real-world perspective on the intersection of business operations and cybersecurity risk. I gained experience in:

- Mapping out critical business functions within a large IT organization  
- Evaluating dependencies like personnel, systems, and external vendors  
- Defining RTO (Recovery Time Objective), RPO (Recovery Point Objective), and MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime)  
- Calculating the potential cost of operational disruptions in a cloud services environment  
- Analyzing how regulatory penalties and reputational damage affect business resilience  
- Structuring a formal BIA report to communicate technical risks in business language

This project helped me understand the importance of **risk-based planning** and the need for cross-functional coordination between IT, security, and business units ‚Äî lessons I‚Äôll continue building on as I pursue cybersecurity roles in GRC and risk management.
