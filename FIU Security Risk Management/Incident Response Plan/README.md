# SummitTech Solutions ‚Äî Incident Response Plan (IRP)

## üìå Synopsis  
A historic winter storm system is about to develop over the Rocky Mountains, bringing blizzards and extreme cold to the Denver, Colorado area.  
It is forecasted that massive power outages along with infrastructure failures may occur.  
Simultaneously, a bomb cyclone storm is moving into Seattle, Washington, with hurricane-force winds, possible coastal flooding, and potentially widespread power outages.

This **dual disaster event** could cripple SummitTech Solutions.  
Both of their data centers (Seattle, WA and Denver, CO) are at risk. The crisis could affect:
- Critical operations
- IT infrastructure
- Customer service
- Cloud services
- Security Operations Center (SOC)

SummitTech wants to verify that their **Business Continuity Plan (BCP)** is ready for execution.  
Our goal: Identify the appropriate **Incident Response** to address the challenges and minimize the impact of this storm on critical infrastructure and personnel.

## üéØ Goals and Objectives  

### Goal  
Develop an **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** documenting mitigating steps against the adverse weather event, including changing conditions and resulting actions.

### Objectives  
- Determine who in the company is responsible for recognizing the incident and activating the BCP  
- Define communication steps to acknowledge and escalate the event  
- Quickly establish the **Incident Response Team (IRT)**  
- Identify pre-defined tasks (24‚Äì72 hours before) to protect assets, personnel, and critical functions  
- Monitor adverse events and document impact scope  
- During the event, document actions to maintain security, integrity, and critical services  
- After the event (24‚Äì72 hours), document actions needed for critical services and possible workforce augmentation  
- Document changes to the IRP due to changing conditions  
- Identify a key business function/process that has failed and provide its corresponding **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)**  
- Determine restoration steps when conditions subside  
- Conduct a **lessons learned** analysis (what went well, major issues, mitigations, improvements)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IRP Approach  

- Use the **NIST Incident Handling Checklist** for guidance  
- Review the **BIA** and **Risk Assessment & Threat Analysis**  
- Evaluate the event nature and cross-check with the BCP  
- Determine if an existing IRP addresses the scenario; if not, adapt/create a new playbook  
- During the event: execute or adapt the IRP  
- After the event: document recovery steps and outcomes  
- Once normal operations are restored, communicate company‚Äôs stable and fully operational status
