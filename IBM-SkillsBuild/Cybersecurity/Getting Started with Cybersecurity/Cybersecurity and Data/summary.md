## üîê Module 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity

- **Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting and recovering data, networks, devices, and programs from malicious cyberattacks.
- **Cybersecurity Threats**:
  - **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in hardware, firmware, or software.
  - **Attackers**: Hackers who bypass security without authorization.
  - **Malware**: Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems.
- **Key Elements of Cybersecurity**:
  - **People**: Often the weakest link. Requires proper training and awareness.
  - **Processes**: Security should be built into all organizational processes.
  - **Technology**: Tools like firewalls, antimalware, and email security help protect systems.

## üîè Module 2: Data Privacy

- **Sensitive Data Types**:
  - **Public**: Freely accessible without restriction.
  - **Confidential**: Protected from unauthorized access (e.g., company data, PII, PHI).
    - **Proprietary**: Organization-owned and confidential.
    - **Private**: Personal data not meant for public access.
    - **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data used to identify individuals.
    - **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Medical data that can identify a person.

- **Data Protection**:
  - **Data Security**: Prevents unauthorized access or destruction.
  - **Data Privacy**: Specifically targets unauthorized use/disclosure of personal info.

- **Consequences of Poor Data Privacy**:
  - **Financial**: Fines, settlements, recovery costs.
  - **Operational**: System downtime and restoration.
  - **Reputational**: Loss of trust and damaged brand.

- **Privacy Best Practices**:
  - **Management**: Document processes and assign responsibilities.
  - **Notice**: Inform users about data use.
  - **Choice and Consent**: Gain permission before collecting/using data.
  - **Collection**: Only gather necessary data.
  - **Use, Retention, Disposal**: Use as intended, store only as long as needed, then dispose.
  - **Access**: Let users view their personal info.
  - **Disclosure**: Share with third parties only with consent.
  - **Security**: Protect data from unauthorized access.
  - **Quality**: Ensure data accuracy.
  - **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Audit and uphold policies.

## üß± Module 3: Data Security

- **CIA Triad**:
  - **Confidentiality**: Limit access to only authorized individuals.
  - **Integrity**: Ensure accuracy and prevent unauthorized changes.
  - **Availability**: Ensure reliable and timely access to data.

- **Key Security Parameters**:
  - **Sensitivity**: Which data is sensitive?
  - **Storage**: Where is the data stored?
  - **Access**: Who has access?
  - **Flow**: How does the data move?
  - **Monitoring**: How is access tracked?

- **Security Controls**:
  - **Administrative**: Policies, guidelines, and procedures.
  - **Physical**: Access-restricting devices or structures.
  - **Technical**: Software/hardware like encryption and antivirus tools.

- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**:
  - **Data at Rest**: Stored on devices like USBs, hard drives, servers.
  - **Data in Motion**: Moving across a network.
  - **Data in Use**: Actively processed by applications.

- **Types of DLP Systems**:
  - **File-Level DLP**: Embeds metadata into files to maintain security.
  - **Network DLP**: Monitors all transfers for privacy violations.
  - **Cloud DLP**: Secures data before it is stored in the cloud.
  - **Endpoint DLP**: Monitors devices like computers and servers for data leaks.
