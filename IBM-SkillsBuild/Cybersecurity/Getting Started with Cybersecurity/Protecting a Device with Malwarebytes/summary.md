## ⚠️ Module 1: Threats to Devices and Networks

### 🐞 Malware Types

- **Malware**: Unauthorized software that compromises confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.
- **Virus**: Needs user interaction to run; spreads via file attachments, corrupts or deletes data.
- **Worm**: Self-replicating malware that spreads without user action; can turn devices into "zombies."
- **Trojan Horse**: Disguised as a helpful program; secretly gives attacker remote access.
- **Ransomware**: Locks systems or files and demands ransom to unlock them.
- **Spyware**: Secretly collects sensitive user info (e.g., login credentials, browsing history).
- **Adware**: Displays unwanted ads; may alter browser settings or install extensions.
- **Browser Hijacker**: Changes browser settings without permission, often used for adware.

### 🛡️ Antimalware Software

- Detects, quarantines, and eliminates malware.
- Part of **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** systems:
  - Sends logs and scan results to a central server.
  - Uses **malware signatures** to detect known threats.

### 🎭 Social Engineering

- Manipulation tactics used to steal confidential information.
- **Phishing**: Tricking users into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive data.
- **Common signs of phishing**:
  - Suspicious sender address
  - Generic greeting
  - Grammar/spelling issues
  - Requests for personal info
  - Suspicious URLs

### 🍪 Cookies & Tracking

- Cookies store login info, preferences, and activity from a website.
- **Tracking cookies** (trackers) monitor browsing across websites.
- Attackers may hijack cookies to impersonate users (cookie hijacking).

### 👂 Eavesdropping & Session Hijacking

- **Eavesdropping**: Secretly listening to unencrypted communications.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**: Intercepts and potentially alters data between two systems.
- **Session Hijacking**: Real-time takeover of an active session.
- Open/unsecured networks are especially vulnerable.

### 🔒 VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)

- Encrypts communication between two endpoints.
- Prevents attackers from viewing or intercepting network activity.
- Essential for protecting data on public Wi-Fi or untrusted networks.
