## 🔍 Key Techniques Powering TTS

To achieve natural-sounding speech, TTS systems blend NLP with other AI techniques:

### 🤖 1. Machine Learning
- Trains on **hours of human speech and matching text**
- Learns to add **intonation, rhythm, and stress**
- Enhances the **realism** of synthetic speech

### ✂️ 2. Text Processing
- Breaks down text into parts like **sentences and words**
- Corrects **spelling**, punctuation, and formatting
- Standardizes text (e.g., lowercase, spacing)

### 🎛️ 3. Customization & Personalization
- Users can:
  - Choose from **different voices**
  - Adjust **speaking speed**
  - Modify **speech style**
- Businesses can maintain a **consistent brand voice**

### 🔌 4. Integration with APIs
- Easily integrate TTS into:
  - 🖥️ Websites
  - 📱 Mobile apps
  - 🛠️ Other platforms
- Done using **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**

### 🛠️ 5. Feedback & Improvement
- Developers continually improve the system by:
  - Updating **phonetic databases**
  - Incorporating **user feedback**
