# 📄 Summarizing Data Using IBM Granite

This module explores the use of IBM Granite large language models (LLMs) to perform **automatic text summarization**, a generative AI technique used to condense content from one or more documents into a concise summary without losing key information.

## 🧠 What Is Automatic Text Summarization?

Automatic text summarization (also known as document summarization) is a technique that uses AI to generate short, coherent, and meaningful summaries from longer text documents.

### ✨ Types of Summarization:
1. **Extractive Summarization**  
   Selects and combines key sentences directly from the original text. Best for factual, structured content requiring high accuracy.

2. **Abstractive Summarization**  
   Generates new phrases or sentences to convey the core meaning. Ideal for complex or unstructured content that benefits from rephrasing.

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Generative AI for Summarization

- **✅ Accuracy** – Uses NLP to understand context, reducing errors and omissions.
- **📈 Scalability** – Handles high-volume summarization tasks quickly and efficiently.
- **🎯 Consistency** – Produces uniform, unbiased summaries regardless of the author.

## ⚠️ Common Challenges & How AI Helps

| Challenge | AI Solution |
|----------|-------------|
| Information Overload | Condenses large data into key points |
| Domain-Specific Context | Tailors summaries to specific fields |
| Complex Language | Simplifies jargon-heavy content |
| Inconsistent Output | Ensures standardized, reliable summaries |
| Language Barriers | Supports multilingual summarization |

## 🧾 Crafting Effective Prompts for Summarization

Prompts guide how the model generates summaries. Good prompts are:

1. **Clear** – Avoid ambiguity and state goals directly.
2. **Contextual** – Include background and intended audience.
3. **Formatted** – Provide examples to clarify expected output structure.
