# 🧠 Classifying Data Using IBM Granite

Classifying data means organizing information into categories to uncover insights and trends. With the power of **Generative AI** and **IBM Granite models**, text classification becomes faster, more scalable, and more accurate.

---

## 🗂️ Types of Text Classification

1. 🔀 **Binary** – Two possible categories (e.g., spam or not spam).
2. 🎯 **Multi-class** – One category out of many (e.g., email topics).
3. 🏷️ **Multi-label** – Multiple categories for one item (e.g., genres for a movie).

> 🔍 **Tip**: Choose your classification type based on whether your data fits one, multiple, or binary categories.
