# 🧠 Unleashing the Power of AI Agents – IBM SkillsBuild

## 📘 Overview
This module explains the transition from **monolithic AI models** to **compound AI systems**, emphasizing how **AI agents** autonomously complete tasks by reasoning, acting, and learning—far beyond what traditional AI can do with fixed rules or limited training data.

## 🤖 What Are AI Agents?

An **AI agent** is a system or program capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or system. Instead of needing step-by-step instructions, AI agents identify goals and determine the best way to achieve them.

### Key Differences from Traditional AI:
| Traditional AI | AI Agents |
|----------------|-----------|
| Follows fixed rules or models | Goal-driven and adaptive |
| Requires user decisions | Acts autonomously |
| Limited by training data | Can use tools, memory, and reasoning |

## 🧩 Core Capabilities of AI Agents

1. **Perception** – Collects and interprets environmental data.
2. **Reasoning** – Analyzes options and determines optimal actions.
3. **Action** – Executes chosen actions digitally or physically.
4. **Memory & Learning** – Remembers past interactions to improve.
5. **Communication** – Uses natural language to interact with users.
6. **Autonomy** – Operates independently to achieve objectives.

## ⚙️ Components of an AI Agent

- **Perception Methods**: Gather data from surroundings.
- **Actuators**: Translate decisions into actions.
- **Learning System**: Improves performance over time.
- **Decision-Making Mechanism**: The “brain” that plans and chooses actions.
- **Environment**: The space and context in which the agent operates.

## 🔄 Workflow of an AI Agent

1. **Perceive** – Collect data (e.g., text, sensor, system inputs).
2. **Interpret** – Analyze the data to understand intent or patterns.
3. **Decide** – Choose an action based on goals and conditions.
4. **Act** – Execute the selected task or generate a response.
5. **Reflect** – Learn from past actions and outcomes.

## 🧠 Types of AI Agents

### 1. Goal-Based AI Agents
- Follow clear objectives using planning and reasoning.
- **Use cases**: Navigation systems, e-commerce delivery assurance.

### 2. Utility-Based AI Agents
- Optimize decisions by weighing tradeoffs and maximizing rewards.
- **Use cases**: Investment portfolios, customer incentives.

### 3. Learning AI Agents
- Adapt and improve over time through experience and feedback.
- **Use cases**: AI tutors, fraud detection systems.
