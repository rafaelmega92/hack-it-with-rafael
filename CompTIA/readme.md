After earning my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Florida International University (FIU), I realized that the field was incredibly broad. I wanted to specialize in something meaningful and impactful—and that’s when I discovered cybersecurity.

My journey began with a Google-sponsored Cybersecurity course on Coursera. I enjoyed every part of it, and by the end of the program, it mentioned that I would be ready to take the CompTIA Security+ exam. At the time, I had never heard of Security+, so I did some research and learned that it’s a widely recognized entry-level certification in the cybersecurity field.

I decided to take on the challenge. To prepare, I purchased a Udemy course and dedicated about two months to studying the material on my own. When I finally took the Security+ exam, I passed on my first attempt—all through self-study and determination.

That success fueled my motivation to continue on the CompTIA certification path. My next goals are to earn the CySA+, PenTest+, and eventually the SecurityX certification (when available). I'm excited to continue growing in this field and sharing my progress here.
