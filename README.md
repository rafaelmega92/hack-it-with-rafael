🔐 Hack It With Rafael
Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey into the world of cybersecurity as I work toward completing my MBA in Cybersecurity Risk Management at Florida International University (FIU).

As I develop technical and strategic skills in areas like SOC operations, cyber risk management, and network defense, I’ll be sharing write-ups, walkthroughs, and mini-projects here to showcase my learning and growth.

🧭 Goals
- 📚 Complete foundational and intermediate labs on TryHackMe and similar platforms

- 🧪 Build and document a home cybersecurity lab (including tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Splunk, etc.)

- 🔐 Explore GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) concepts and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)

- 📄 Create short write-ups that reflect real-world scenarios and skill application

 -🤝 Connect with professionals and demonstrate readiness for cybersecurity roles

🧰 Tools & Technologies
- TryHackMe | Wireshark | Kali Linux

- Splunk | Metasploit | Nmap

- VirtualBox / VMware | Security Onion

- NIST CSF | Microsoft Defender
(More tools added as I progress)
