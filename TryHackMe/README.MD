# TryHackMe Labs

Welcome to my **TryHackMe** folder!

This repository documents my progress as I complete various modules, rooms, and challenges on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). The platform helps build hands-on cybersecurity skills in areas like offensive security, defensive security, network analysis, and more.

## Purpose
- ðŸŒŸ To reinforce my cybersecurity knowledge through practical, scenario-based learning.
- ðŸŒŸ To develop and showcase my skills in penetration testing, ethical hacking, incident response, and related domains.
- ðŸŒŸ To create notes and artifacts I (and others!) can refer back to for study or project work.

## Structure
Each subfolder in this repository will correspond to a specific TryHackMe room or module. Inside, youâ€™ll find:
- Notes and summaries
- Screenshots of key steps or results (where appropriate)
- Scripts, configs, or commands I used
- Reflections and lessons learned

## Modules Completed / In Progress
- **Offensive Security Intro** (in progress)
- *(More to come â€” stay tuned!)*

## Disclaimer
All activities are conducted in legal, controlled environments as part of educational exercises on TryHackMe.
