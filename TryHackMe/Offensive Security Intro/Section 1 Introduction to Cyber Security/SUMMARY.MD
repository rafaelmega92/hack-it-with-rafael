# 🔐 TryHackMe: Introduction to Cybersecurity - Notes

This document summarizes my learning from the **Introduction to Cybersecurity** module on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/). The room provides foundational knowledge about offensive and defensive security concepts, tools, and roles in cybersecurity.

## 💣 Introduction to Offensive Security

- Offensive security focuses on **breaking into computer systems**, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access.
- The goal is to understand hacker tactics and improve system defenses.
- Example technique: Using tools like `dirb` to brute-force and discover hidden URLs or features.
- Key roles: **Red Teamers**, **Penetration Testers**.

## 🛡️ Introduction to Defensive Security

- Defensive security focuses on:
  - Preventing intrusions.
  - Detecting intrusions and responding appropriately.
- Blue teams play a critical role in defense.

### Key Defensive Practices
- User cybersecurity awareness and training.
- Documenting and managing assets.
- Updating and patching systems against known vulnerabilities.
- Using preventative security devices (e.g., firewalls, intrusion prevention systems).
- Logging and monitoring to detect malicious activities.

## 🧩 Areas of Defensive Security

### 🏢 Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Monitors systems and networks for malicious activity.
- Responds to:
  - Vulnerabilities.
  - Policy violations.
  - Unauthorized activities.
  - Network intrusions.
- Uses **threat intelligence** to build threat-informed defenses.

### 🔍 Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

#### 🧪 Digital Forensics
- Analyzes evidence of attacks or other malicious activities.
- Focus areas:
  - File system artifacts.
  - System memory images.
  - System and network logs.

#### 🚨 Incident Response
- Methodology to handle incidents, reduce damage, and recover quickly.
- Four major phases:
  1. **Preparation**
  2. **Detection & Analysis**
  3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**
  4. **Post-Incident Activity**

#### 🦠 Malware Analysis
- Understands and studies malicious software (e.g., viruses, trojans, ransomware).
- Techniques:
  - **Static analysis**: Examine code without executing it.
  - **Dynamic analysis**: Run malware in a controlled environment and monitor behavior.
