# 🚀 Section 1: Start Your Cyber Security Journey  

This section introduces the foundations of **search skills and information gathering**—critical abilities for anyone starting in cybersecurity. It covers how to evaluate sources, use search engines effectively, leverage specialized tools, and access reliable documentation.

## 🔍 Search Skills  
When evaluating information, consider:  
- **Source** – Who published it? Are they reputable?  
- **Evidence & Reasoning** – Are claims backed by credible facts?  
- **Objectivity & Bias** – Is it impartial and well-balanced?  
- **Corroboration & Consistency** – Can it be verified across multiple sources?  

👉 A **bogus cryptographic method or product** is often called **Snake Oil**.

## 🌐 Search Engines  
Google supports powerful search operators, including:  
- `"exact phrase"` – Finds pages with the exact phrase.  
- `site:` – Limits results to a specific domain.  
- `-` – Excludes results containing specific words.  
- `filetype:` – Finds specific file formats (PDF, DOC, XLS, PPT, etc.).

## 🛰️ Specialized Search Engines  
- **Shodan** – Search engine for internet-connected devices (servers, IoT, industrial systems).  
- **Censys** – Maps internet assets (domains, certificates, open ports).  
- **VirusTotal** – Scans files/URLs with multiple antivirus engines; supports file hash lookups.  
- **Have I Been Pwned** – Checks if your email has appeared in a data breach.  

---

## 🛠️ Vulnerabilities & Exploits  
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** – Standardized identifiers for security flaws (e.g., CVE-2024-29988).  
- **Exploit Database** – Repository of exploit codes published by various authors.  

---

## 📚 Technical Documentation  
- **Linux Man Pages** – Command references, system calls, and config file docs.  
- **Microsoft Windows Docs** – Official product documentation.  
- **Product Documentation** – Authoritative source of product features and functions.  

---

## 💬 Social Media  
- Use **temporary emails** to explore unfamiliar platforms safely.  
- Be cautious of **oversharing**—especially when protecting an organization.  
- Social platforms connect you with experts, companies, and communities to **grow your technical expertise**.

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- Always verify information with **reputable sources and multiple confirmations**.  
- Google operators like `site:` and `filetype:` are powerful tools for focused research.  
- Specialized search engines (Shodan, Censys, VirusTotal) are key in cybersecurity investigations.  
- **CVE IDs** provide a universal way to track vulnerabilities.  
- Official documentation and manuals are **trustworthy references** for learning.  
- Social media can be a double-edged sword—great for knowledge, risky for oversharing.
